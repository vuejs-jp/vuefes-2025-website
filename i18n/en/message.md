Japan's largest Vue.js conference, Vue Fes Japan, is back again this year!

Vue Fes Japan began in 2018 with the very purpose of celebrating, learning, and—most importantly—enjoying Vue.js together, much like a festival.

The previous Vue Fes Japan 2024 was a fantastic event, drawing around 750 participants from both Japan and overseas, and truly showcased the passion of our community.

In September last year, the latest stable release, Vue 3.5, was launched and has now grown to over 6.4 million downloads per week. Moreover, the in-development Vue 3.6 is expected to bring even greater performance improvements with its experimental Vapor project and new reactivity system based on alien-signals, promising further evolution.

The ecosystem surrounding Vue.js is also gaining momentum. The official ESLint plugin, eslint-plugin-vue v10, and the new Vue DevTools are now available, while the meta-framework Nuxt and its server engine Nitro continue to evolve further alongside the UnJS project, gearing up for the next generation.

Additionally, last October, Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, launched a new company, VoidZero, to advance the development of the next-generation JavaScript toolchain. Projects like Vite, Vitest, Rolldown, and Oxc—as part of VoidZero’s open source initiatives—are set to make a significant impact not only on the Vue.js community but also on the broader JavaScript ecosystem.

This is the place where you can experience cutting-edge information and trends firsthand—that’s Vue Fes Japan 2025. This year, to ensure even more people can enjoy the event, we are pursuing initiatives toward internationalization, such as rebranding the conference for its evolution and providing English translations for Japanese sessions. Let’s come together to share an authentic experience and excitement!
