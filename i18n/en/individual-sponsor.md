### 【Important】

Participation in Vue Fes Japan requires a General Admission Ticket in addition to an Individual Sponsor Ticket. Please note that you cannot enter with only the Individual Sponsor Ticket. If you will not be attending on the day, you may purchase only the Individual Sponsor Ticket (benefits will be limited to credit listing).
