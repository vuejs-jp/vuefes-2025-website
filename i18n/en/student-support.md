At Vue Fes Japan 2025, weâ€™re launching a new initiative to support future engineers by offering a special assistance program for students. This program not only helps reduce financial burden, but also provides valuable opportunities to connect with the Vue.js community.

Note: The student support program is intended for residents of Japan only.
