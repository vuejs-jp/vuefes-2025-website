### Talents discovered by kazupon ── Developer discovery techniques that change Vue.js and the OSS ecosystem

The development of the Vue.js ecosystem comes not only from technology, but also from connections between developers. A comment on an issue, a review of a PR, such small interactions eventually grow into large projects. There are places where you can experience the power of such a community.

In this panel discussion, three developers active in Vue.js-related projects will talk about their collaborative experiences that started from encounters in the community. While working in different fields such as development tools, performance optimization, and internationalization support, how have they stimulated and supported each other? We will share the possibilities that human connections through technology can create, including actual experiences.
